## 0.1.4 (2026-09-17)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Internal cleanup: the plugin consumes the shared `PluginLoggerLike` contract from `@yadsh/dsh-plugin-log` instead of a private copy, and its package verification gates run through the shared runner. No runtime behavior changed. ([c8b9d2f](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/c8b9d2f))

### 🧱 Updated Dependencies

- Updated @yadsh/dsh-plugin-log to 0.4.0

## 0.1.3 (2026-09-15)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Reformat the package with the repository's shared Prettier configuration. The ([ddba2dd](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/ddba2dd))
  config now lives in the repository root instead of inside four packages, and
  this sweep brings every package to it. Formatting only — no behavior and no API
  change beyond the reformatted sources in the published tarball.

### 🧱 Updated Dependencies

- Updated @yadsh/dsh-plugin-log to 0.3.1

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-13)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Make the published packages discoverable to the DSH ecosystem. npm only serves ([76bdc53](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/76bdc53))
  what a published tarball carries, so every package now ships the canonical
  keyword set (`deepseek`, `deepseek-harness`, `dsh`, `dsh-plugin`, `cordis`) plus
  its own feature words, alongside the repository, homepage, and bug-tracker
  metadata that ties the package back to its directory in this monorepo. DSH
  directories and marketplace indexes discover plugins through those keywords and
  through the `dsh-plugin` GitHub topic, and an indexer that cannot attribute a
  package to its sources reports it as published without a public repository.
  Packages that ship no keywords at all were invisible to those indexes. The
  repository root also gains a generated `plugins.json` catalog that maps every
  npm name to its directory, install command, and homepage, and the package
  hygiene gate now rejects a manifest whose metadata is missing or stale.

  The published tarball also stops carrying repository documentation — specs,
  changelogs, roadmaps, design docs, integration notes, and README translations
  stay in the repository, so an install pulls the runtime and the bundle patch
  instead of prose. Relative links in a published README now point at GitHub
  where the tarball no longer holds the target.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-12)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Retest against the DSH 0.1.5-rc.2 baseline with no code changes; the ([458b9c2](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/458b9c2))
  compatibility contract and README requirements move to
  `>=0.1.5-rc.2 <0.2.0`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-10)

### 🚀 Features

- Add the content-addressed tool-result store: bulky successful tool outputs are ([7777608](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/7777608))
  stored once by SHA-256, the session keeps a bounded deterministic preview plus
  a stable reference, and `dsh_cas_retrieve` / `dsh_cas_search` / `dsh_cas_info`
  / `dsh_cas_stats` provide bounded retrieval, search, metadata, and aggregate
  statistics with TTL and quota garbage collection.
