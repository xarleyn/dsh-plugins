## 0.1.3 (2026-09-18)

### 🩹 Fixes

- The first `domain_expert` call after a plugin start no longer refuses with "Domain storage is not open yet". ([cd4ee96](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/cd4ee96))

  The storage open is lazy and memoized, and the tools resolved their definition through a synchronous handle check: the one call that raced the open was refused, and because models rarely retry, a restart silently cost the first delegation. The tool dependencies now await the one-time open, so the racing call waits and proceeds; a storage failure that already happened surfaces its underlying `STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE` cause ("Domain storage could not be opened: …") instead of the misleading "not open yet".

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-17)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Internal cleanup: tests share the `fixedClock` fixture from `@yadsh/dsh-test-kit`, and package verification gates run through the shared runner. No runtime changes. ([c8b9d2f](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/c8b9d2f))

### 🧱 Updated Dependencies

- Updated @yadsh/dsh-plugin-log to 0.4.0

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-15)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Reformat the package with the repository's shared Prettier configuration. The ([ddba2dd](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/ddba2dd))
  config now lives in the repository root instead of inside four packages, and
  this sweep brings every package to it. Formatting only — no behavior and no API
  change beyond the reformatted sources in the published tarball.

### 🧱 Updated Dependencies

- Updated @yadsh/dsh-plugin-log to 0.3.1

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-13)

### 🚀 Features

- Initial release of the Domain Experts plugin. A domain is a persisted expert ([dc6ad70](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/dc6ad70))
  profile — persona, filesystem and knowledge scope, memory namespace, tool
  policy, cross-domain policy and model policy — created in a new
  `Settings → Plugins → Domain Experts` tab. Experts run as ordinary DSH
  subagents through the native runtime, so the plugin composes the request
  instead of re-implementing agent execution. The plugin reports every
  restriction as either enforced or advisory, so a filesystem rule is never
  presented as isolation it does not have. Cross-domain questions go through the
  owning expert, with a machine-enforced mode, target list, depth cap and
  parallel budget; memory is partitioned by namespace at the storage-key level.
  Scope providers, memory backends and workers are public extension seams.
