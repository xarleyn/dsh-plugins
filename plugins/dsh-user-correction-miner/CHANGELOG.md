## 0.2.1 (2026-09-13)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Make the published packages discoverable to the DSH ecosystem. npm only serves ([76bdc53](https://github.com/xarleyn/dsh-plugins/commit/76bdc53))
  what a published tarball carries, so every package now ships the canonical
  keyword set (`deepseek`, `deepseek-harness`, `dsh`, `dsh-plugin`, `cordis`) plus
  its own feature words, alongside the repository, homepage, and bug-tracker
  metadata that ties the package back to its directory in this monorepo. DSH
  directories and marketplace indexes discover plugins through those keywords and
  through the `dsh-plugin` GitHub topic, and an indexer that cannot attribute a
  package to its sources reports it as published without a public repository.
  Packages that ship no keywords at all were invisible to those indexes. The
  repository root also gains a generated `plugins.json` catalog that maps every
  npm name to its directory, install command, and homepage, and the package
  hygiene gate now rejects a manifest whose metadata is missing or stale.

  The published tarball also stops carrying repository documentation — specs,
  changelogs, roadmaps, design docs, integration notes, and README translations
  stay in the repository, so an install pulls the runtime and the bundle patch
  instead of prose. Relative links in a published README now point at GitHub
  where the tarball no longer holds the target.

  management responses, use the shared DSH home, make correction truncation
  Unicode-safe, bound miner retention and pending state, restore strict host
  type checking for session scope, pause UI polling in hidden tabs, and align
  published package metadata, compatibility declarations, and build lifecycle
  gates.
